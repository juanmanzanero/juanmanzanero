### Hi there 👋

I am Juan Manzanero, from Talavera de la Reina (Spain). Apparently now its time to put an emoji-bullet list that highlights what I am good at, so here it goes:

 📌 Based in Germany <br />
 🎓 PhD. in aerospace engineering<br />
 🚀 I currently work at European Space Agency, on spacecrafts commands generations for interplanetary science missions like Solar Orbiter and Juice (Jupiter icy moons explorer)<br />
 🌀 My previous experience includes research in high order methods applied to fluid dynamics. I have contributed to the development of entropy-stable schemes for multiphase flows, turbulent flows, and shock capturing<br />
 💻 Computer languages: C/C++, Fortran, Matlab and Python<br />
 🏎️ I am also interested in vehicle dynamics and lap-time optimization<br />
