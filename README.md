### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Juan Manzanero, doctor of aerospace engineer, and I work at European Space Agency in Germany.

Iâ€™m currently working on spacecrafts commands generations in interplanetary science missions like Solar Orbiter and Juice (Jupiter icy moons explorer).

My previous experience includes research in high order methods applied to fluid dynamics. I have contributed to the development of entropy-stable schemes for multiphase flows, turbulent flows, and shock capturing.

I am also interested in vehicle dynamics and lap-time optimization.
